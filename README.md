# Business Performance Analysis with SQL

## Introduction

In this project I did an analysis of a [business dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ml2oJ7JxAYgv3uTSXIoS0V1CUcSg-j2d?usp=sharing). This project is also a part of Mini Projects Programs developed by [Rakamin Academy](https://www.rakamin.com/) to help students to increase their portofolio. The point of this project is to find some insights that can be used as a basis of future decision by the stakeholders. The tools that I used are SQL to query necessary data to make insight and also Tableau Public to visualize the insights

## Work stages

- Creating workspace (database, table) with suitable datatype
- Add constraint such as Primary Key and Foreign Key
- Generate an Entity Relationship Diagram to make it easier to understand the flow and connection of each tables
- Querying tables that will be used as the basis of the analysis
- Visualize using Tableau Public

## Analysis

- Annual Customer Activity Growth Analysis
  In this analysis I tried to show the growth of customer activity over the year, including average monthly active user, new customer, repeat customer and average      transactions per customer. This analysis can show how much each and every customer actually engage with this business
- Annual Product Category Quality Analysis
  The second analysis trying to show which category is giving the most revenue and also which category is repeatedly being canceled by the customer. This insight can help the company to prioritize or giving more attention to some specific categories
- Annual Payment Type Usage
  The last analysis is about payment type. Which payment is being used a lot by the customer? Popular payment type can be give some sort of discount or special promotion to increase the number of transactions.

## Files
In this repo I uploaded the [summary of the analysis](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RvRV-fnxehjaf4mLJkhz_WUqAlqEQDnG/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114946348005044264289&rtpof=true&sd=true), the query .sql files, and the ERD .pgerd file. All the query and tableau can also be accesed from the link provided inside the summary file.
